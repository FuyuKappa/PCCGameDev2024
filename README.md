# Error: 403

A truly experimental approach in the ever-growing arms-race of the tech world, you are an adaptive AI born with the sole purpose of securing the digital world from all kinds of malicious software. However, just as you were deployed in to the digital realm, you immediately run into the world's most dangerous botnet: Flock of the shepherd (FotS). Your ability to adapt and restructure your code lets you survive the encounter, but the code they have managed to inject into you is an ever-worsening crisis. As the botnet focuses their computing power into breaking your defenses and making you part of their flock, you must traverse through various devices and nodes such as servers serving websites for the internet, to the average college student's laptop connected to the library WiFi. You will fight other malware of varying threat levels to adapt and mature your source code, letting you go toe-to-toe with more powerful malware, and eventually take down the master nodes of the flock: The Shepherd. Along your journey, you can run into other anti-malware programs and learn their unique approaches to make yourself more prepared in your adventure to free yourself from the grasp of the flock.

Error: 403 is a 3D rogue-like action game with procedurally generated levels where you build your own character's strength. Use various code blocks, conditional statements, expressions, and literals you find in the levels or learn from other pieces of software so that you can become any malware's worst nightmare.
