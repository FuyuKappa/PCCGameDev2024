# Error: 403

A truly experimental approach in the ever-growing arms-race of the tech world, you are an adaptive AI born with the sole purpose of securing the digital world from all kinds of malicious software. However, just as you were deployed in to the digital realm, you immediately run into the world's most dangerous botnet: Flock of the shepherd (FotS). Your ability to adapt and restructure your code lets you survive the encounter, but the code they have managed to inject into you is an ever-worsening crisis. As the botnet focuses their computing power into breaking your defenses and making you part of their flock, you must traverse through various devices and nodes such as servers serving websites for the internet, to the average college student's laptop connected to the library WiFi. You will fight other malware of varying threat levels to adapt and mature your source code, letting you go toe-to-toe with more powerful malware, and eventually take down the master nodes of the flock: The Shepherd. Along your journey, you can run into other anti-malware programs and learn their unique approaches to make yourself more prepared in your adventure to free yourself from the grasp of the flock.

Error: 403 is a 3D rogue-like action game with procedurally generated levels where you build your own character's strength. Use various code blocks, conditional statements, expressions, and literals you find in the levels or learn from other pieces of software so that you can become any malware's worst nightmare. 

## Gameplay Highlights
* Procedurally generated levels
  * Online Nodes
    * These includes websites which can be infected with various malware such as spyware, adware, and mining scripts
  * Offline Nodes
    * Explore devices which could be infected with ransomeware, trojans, worms, and viruses.
  * You can choose which nodes to travel to which will affect what codebases you'll run into, thus, the kinds of builds you can make.
* Build-it-yourself buffs and abilities
  * Build your own conditional statements.
    * Each code block represents a possible buff, and must be started with a if-statement or while(true)-loops.
    * Once an if-block resolves to true, its contents will only be invoked once. For-loops will allow single events to be triggered multiple times in the same if-block.
    * While(true)-loops are powerful code blocks, acting basically like passive buffs. However, power comes as a cost, literally. You can only put a limited amount of expressions in these blocks to avoid overloading your threads.
    * For-loops IDK how to balance these ones yet but these should allow activating certain statements a certain amount of times e.x. Heal 3HP three times.
  * String together statements, expressions, and literals to strengthen yourself the way you want.
* Different starting paradigms
  * Normal IDK what to call it. A vanilla run.
  * Divide n' Conquer - Half your health, half your defense, half your everything? Worry not, you are not alone. You get to duplicate yourself and attack your enemies from two different places. Gets access to modules that increase your clones etc.
  * Brute Force - Higher base stats for a more simple experience. I think this should either add a statement limit to even if-blocks, as well as decrease the limit in while(true) or disallow the use of the latter entirely.
  * Dynamic Program - Lower (slightly?) base stats due to the increase computational power needed for running your unique code blocks: Recursion. Carefully manage your buffs or else you run the risk of a stack overflow.
  * And more idk.
